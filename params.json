{"name":"Symphony","tagline":"Electrophysiology Data Acquisition System","body":"## Symphony Data Acquisition System\r\n\r\nSymphony is a data acquisition system focused on electrophysiology experiments. Symphony allows research scientists to write user-configurable acquisition routines in MATLAB. It also provides an interface to run those routines as part of an overall experiment.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nThere are two main components of Symphony: the core framework and the MATLAB interface. At the moment these components need to be installed separately.\r\n\r\n#### Core Framework:\r\n\r\nDownload the [latest nightly build](https://build.physionconsulting.com/job/symphony-core/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/src/symphony-core/SymphonyWixInstaller/bin/x86/Release/Symphony.msi) of the core framework and run the installer.\r\n\r\n#### MATLAB Interface:\r\n\r\nClone the Symphony GitHub repository via Terminal or Git Bash:\r\n\r\n  git clone https://github.com/Symphony-DAS/Symphony.git\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is available on the [project wiki](https://github.com/Symphony-DAS/Symphony/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Community\r\n\r\nWe have a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/symphony-das) for user and developer support and discussion.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
